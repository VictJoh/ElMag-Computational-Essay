    "## Introduction\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to simulate a polar molecule, hydrogen chloride (HCl), to get a feel for the general behavior of polar molecules under different conditions. The polarity comes from the differing charges in the molecule: as chloride is more electronegative than hydrogen, it will pull more strongly on their shared electron, causing a partial positive charge at the hydrogen and a partial negative charge on the chlorine. In liquid form, between about -85$^\\circ$ and -114$^\\circ$ C, HCl should then behave in much the same way as water (another polar molecule). "

    "1. Can you attract the liquid? \n",
    "    * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqU8vVPX0Cw \n",
    "2. How would the molecules line up with a large charge in the centre? What physical situation would this simulate?\n",
    "3. Is there some way to model surface tension, like water on a teflon pan? \n",
    "4. How would you modify this program to simulate water, instead of HCl?\n",
    "5. Currently, the only intermolecular forces are caused by Coulomb forces. However, this might be a problem if the atoms get too close to one another. What would you add to this simulation to make that behavior more realistic? What effect does this have on the simulation behavior?\n",
    "7. How would the polar molecules react to a homogeneous or inhomogenous electric field? What physical situation would this simulate?\n",
    "8. Is Euler-Chromer the optimal integration method? Why/why not? What changes with other integration methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that one of the first things you might try to do is to animate the motion of the molecules, since it is difficult to envision how the molecules behave during the simulation without being able to see them moving. Matplotlib has an animation library that works well without too much coding required.\n",
